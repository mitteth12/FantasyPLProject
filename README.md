# FantasyPLProject
 This repository will be the home for all the information that is related to my big quest towards achieving something I have never achieved before..... a Fantasy Premier League title! A combination of love for soccer and data analytics merged at my understanding that it would be really fun and engaging to do my best to analysis trends and understand fantasy soccer statistics and see if I can finally get the crown. All credit for Fantasy Premier League stat will be in the link below as it was extremely helpful for saving time and a huge wonderful collection of data is provided. Along with all of my files of work this repository will hold a blog style log of any analysis done and the events around the Premier League.
